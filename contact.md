### Contact Us

For immediate answers to queries, the best way of contacting us is by phone.

<i class="fa fa-phone-square" aria-hidden="true"></i><noscript>Ph:</noscript> {{ site.phone }}

<i class="fa fa-envelope-square" aria-hidden="true"></i> {{ site.email }}

Note to Peter: We can replace the email address here with a contact form if you want. This might reduce the ammount of spam, although there'll be slightly more customer irritation at having to fill out a form. It's obviously up to you.
