# pcelectricalandsolar.com.au

This is a website I made for a small business owner friend of mine. It's actually a Jekyll template and can be easily adapted to serve any small site needs. All the site-specific variables are contained within the config file and can be changed and the site re-built to make something new.

See it live [here](http://www.pcelectricalandsolar.com.au).
